        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Buchupalle Purna Tejeshwara Reddy, and I am a passionate and dedicated professional with a strong foundation in technical industries. With a background in Polytechnic in CSE and Arduino projects, I have honed my skills in various areas, including listening to music, reading books, talking with unknown people, researching new things, solo driving, and more. I have successfully contributed to several projects:
        </p>
        <p>
            During my school days:
            <ul>
                <li>Created a robot with my team that assists in serving items and performing small tasks like welcoming people.</li>
                <li>Participated in a team project analyzing how sperm ejaculation reduces men's stress.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            During my polytechnic studies:
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a movie ticket booking process website.</li>
                <li>Created a fully functional website with indirect backend work.</li>
                <li>Designed a combined hardware and software stick using Arduino for blind people.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past few years, I have gained invaluable experience working with Yoyo Media Square Company, where I contributed to frontend work for the company's website. This experience helped me develop a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the technical landscape in Hyderabad. My approach to work is characterized by creativity, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork, and I am always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy discovering new things, working on potential patents, reading books, and listening to music. These activities help me stay balanced and inspired. I am excited to bring my expertise and enthusiasm to new opportunities and look forward to making meaningful contributions to the teams I work with.
        </p>
